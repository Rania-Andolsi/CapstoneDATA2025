ðŸ§  Project Title: SmartEnergyWatch â€“ Anomaly Detection & Performance Impact Analysis in Energy Consumption

ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This capstone project, conducted within the framework of the Rome Business Schoolâ€™s Master in Data Science, aims to develop a data-driven solution to detect anomalies in energy consumption and analyze the impact of specific equipment issues on overall performance.

Using modern data science techniquesâ€”such as time series analysis, anomaly detection algorithms, and performance prediction modelsâ€”the project seeks to support preventive maintenance, improve energy efficiency, and reduce operational risks in smart industrial or commercial environments.

The proposed solution will simulate or ingest real-world datasets from equipment such as HVAC systems, manufacturing machinery, or server infrastructure, and apply machine learning models to identify unusual patterns and correlate them with system faults or degradation.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Problem Framing: Define clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as kWh per cycle, operational efficiency, idle energy loss, and anomaly rate.

Data Pipeline: Collect, clean, and process energy consumption data and maintenance logs (real or synthetic).

Anomaly Detection: Apply statistical or machine learning techniques (Isolation Forest, LSTM, Prophet, etc.) to detect irregular energy patterns.

Performance Impact Analysis: Assess how detected anomalies correlate with system failures, downtime, or efficiency losses.

Visualization & Reporting: Build an interactive dashboard (e.g., Streamlit, Plotly Dash, or Grafana) to monitor equipment health and anomaly alerts.

Documentation & Architecture: Design a modular, scalable architecture with complete documentation, code, and technical design.
